# IBM Tools for Data Science 

In this module, you will learn about an enterprise-ready data science platform by IBM, called Watson Studio. You'll learn about some of the features and capabilities of what data scientists use in the industry. Youâ€™ll also learn about other IBM tools used to support data science projects, such as IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog, Data Refinery, and the SPSS Modeler.

## Learning Objectives

- Define the Watson Studio.
- Explain how Watson Studio can streamline data projects and make them easier to manage.
- List some of the primary assets included in Watson Studio.
- Create a project in Watson Studio and add an interactive Jupyter workbook to work with a real data set. Link GitHub to Watson Studio and explain when to use public vs. private repositories.
- Describe other tools essential to data science and their applications.
- Describe Data Refinery and how it benefits the data scientists who use it.
- Describe the IBM SSPS Modeler, its usage, and some of the capabilities it offers.
- Load and run a sample project in Watson Studio and examine the results.
- Use Watson Studio to run an autonumeric model, examine the results and get predictions for new use cases.
- Describe the use case for the IBM SPSS Modeler and list a few of its main features.
- Summarize the characteristics of the IBM SPSS Statistics software application and its use by data scientists.
- Explain how models are deployed into production environments.
- Summarize how Auto AI in Watson Studio benefits organizations who lack a fully staffed data science team.
- List the features included with IBM Watson and explain how it ensures fairness and explainability of model drift.
