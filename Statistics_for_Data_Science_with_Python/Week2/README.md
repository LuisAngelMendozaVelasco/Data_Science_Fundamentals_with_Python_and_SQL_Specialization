# Data Visualization

This module will focus on different types of visualization depending on the type of data and information we are trying to communicate. You will learn to calculate and interpret these measures and graphs.

## Learning Objectives

- Define the terms probability, random variable, random events, theoretical probability, and experimental probability, and cumulative distribution function.
- Calculate probability of an event given a normally distributed data set.
- Write null and alternative hypothesis in order to perform a t-test.
- Explain how to use a normal distribution and a T-distribution to accept or reject a null hypothesis.
- Explain how the mean and the standard deviation relates to a normal distribution and a T-distribution.
- Compare and contrast a normal distribution to a t-distribution.
- Interpret the results of a T-test using the p-values and T-score.
- Compare and contrast a T score and a Z score.
- Interpret a Z score in relation to its distribution.
- Interpret the significance level, alpha, in the context of the data used to generate it.
- Describe how to calculate a p-value, a T score, and a Z score.
