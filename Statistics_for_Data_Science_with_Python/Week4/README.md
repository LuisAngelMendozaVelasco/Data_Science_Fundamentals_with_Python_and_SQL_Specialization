# Hypothesis testing

This module will focus on teaching the appropriate test to use when dealing with data and relationships between them. It will explain the assumptions of each test and the appropriate language when interpreting the results of a hypothesis test.

## Learning Objectives

- Devise a situation in which simple linear regression would answer a statistical question.
- Write Python code to conduct a simple linear regression.
- Interpret the results of a simple linear regression.
- Explain how a data set with categorical variables can be transformed to conduct a simple linear regression.
- Write Python code that demonstrates the R-squared value is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient.
