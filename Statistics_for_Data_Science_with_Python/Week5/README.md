# Regression Analysis

This module will dive straight into using python to run regression analysis for testing relationships and differences in sample and population means rather than the classical hypothesis testing and how to interpret them.

## Learning Objectives

- Create a Jupyter Notebook using Watson Studio.
- Generate Python code to create descriptive statistics and visualizations for a given data set.
- Generate Python code to perform a T test, an ANOVA, find the Pearson correlation, and perform regression analysis.
- Interpret the results of a hypothesis test for a T test, an ANOVA, and a regression analysis.
- Create a PowerPoint to showcase your findings from the reading tasks.
- Evaluate your peerâ€™s final project for the course.
