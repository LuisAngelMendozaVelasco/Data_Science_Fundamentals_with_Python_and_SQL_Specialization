# Project Case: Boston Housing Data

In the final week of the course, you will be given a dataset and a scenario where you will use descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing to give some insights about the data you were provided. You will use Watson studio for your analysis and upload your notebook for a peer review and will also review a peer's project. The readings in this module contain the complete information you need.

## Learning Objectives

- Use Watson Studio
- Create a Jupyter Notebook
- Upload your Notebook
- Review a peer's notebook
