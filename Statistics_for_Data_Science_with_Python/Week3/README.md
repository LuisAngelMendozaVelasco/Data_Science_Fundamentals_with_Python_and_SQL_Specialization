# Introduction to Probability Distributions

This module will introduce the basic concepts and application of probability and probability distributions.

## Learning Objectives

- Interpret the results of a hypothesis test.
- Write Python code to conduct hypothesis testing that compares two population means.
- Distinguish between one- and two-tailed T tests.
- Distinguish between correlation tests for two continuous variables and two categorical variables.
- Devise a situation in which it would be appropriate to use an ANOVA.
- Apply a Levene’s test to determine if two populations have equal or unequal variances.
- Write Python code to conduct an ANOVA.
- Interpret the results of an ANOVA in relation to the null hypothesis.
