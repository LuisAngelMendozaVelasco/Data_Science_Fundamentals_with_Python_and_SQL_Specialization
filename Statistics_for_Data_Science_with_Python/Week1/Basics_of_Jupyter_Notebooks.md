# (Optional) Basics of Jupyter Notebooks

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code,  equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. Uses include data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling,  machine learning and, much more.”

– description from [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)

Jupyter Notebook has become the "tool of choice" for the modern Data Scientist. Jupyter took the concept of a paper notebook that scientists use to record experiments and made it digital and interactive. It is also a fantastic learning tool that allows researchers, teachers, and learners to combine computations with descriptive text, multimedia, and graphs. It helps to document experiments by combining computation (code and data) and a narrative explanation, share it with others, and to have it come alive clearly explaining your findings and the path you took to arrive at your conclusions. In short, it helps you tell a story about your experiment. You can also say that Jupyter Notebook and its more modern version JupyterLab is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). But we prefer to think of it as a storytelling tool that makes data come alive.

To make it easy for you to get started, hands-on labs and assignments in this course will use a virtual JupyterLab Notebook environment provided by the Skills Network Labs. You will find it very convenient as you will not have to download, install, or configure any software. You will simply click on the "Open Tool" button. It's like magic!

Note: you can get your own Jupyter Notebooks is by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or you can use Jupyter Notebooks in IBM Watson Studio (we will go in-depth about this later in the course). We don't recommend doing it at this time at the risk of getting distracted. Like a real Data Scientist, you will use Jupyter to:

- Write and run interactive code (we use Python in this course),
- Document and explain what you were doing using markdown text,
- Share your notebooks with other learners, colleagues, and even the world.

Here are just a few very useful tips for using a Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebooks are composed of cells. Each cell can be either: 

- a code cell containing computer code (Python in our course), 
- or a markdown cell containing text, pictures, videos, etc. formatted with markdown (a very simple formatting language).

To get an output from a code cell, you have to run the cell. To run the cell, place your cursor in the cell and click on the Cell menu on the top and click Run Cells. To use a shortcut, press Shift + Enter.

2.  To add a new cell: Click on Insert and insert cell above or below depending on your preference.

3. To delete a cell. Click on Edit and choose Delete Cells

The next lesson will be an optional Python notebook to get you familiar with the pandas and numpy libraries.
