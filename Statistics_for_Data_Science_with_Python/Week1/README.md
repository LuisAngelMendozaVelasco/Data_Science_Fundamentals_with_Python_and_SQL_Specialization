# Introduction & Descriptive Statistics

This module will focus on introducing the basics of descriptive statistics - mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation. It will explain the usefulness of the measures of central tendency and dispersion for different levels of measurement.

## Learning Objectives

- Analyze a data set to determine which type of visualization can be used to represent it.
- Interpret data visualizations.
- Create data visualizations that compare two data sets.
- Create data visualizations that show how data are distributed in Python.
