# Hands-on Lab: Built-in functions

In SQL, you can access many built-in functions that may be used to get more variety in our data analysis. These functions include aggregation functions (like MAX, MIN, SUM, and AVG), string functions (like LENGTH, UCASE, and LCASE), scalar functions (like ROUND), and a variety of date functions as well. In this tab, you'll get hands-on practice on how to use all of them.
